This packet sniffer is developed in Java using JPCAP.
It can intercept and view TCP, UDP and ICMP packets sent over a specified interface.

If you wish to run it on your machine, you need to install WinPCap.

Make sure to allow the driver to start on computer start-up when installing.

JPCAP is also required as a dependency for the project:
